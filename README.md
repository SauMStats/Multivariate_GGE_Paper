# Multivariate joint test (GGE test)

## Overview
This repository contains the R code used for ral data analysis of lipids and alpolipoprotiens in the paper titled **"A multivariate approach to joint testing of main genetic and gene-environment interaction effects"**. The code performs joint testing of main genetic and gene-environment (GxE) effects along with other competing univariate and multivariate tests on lipid phenotypes using data from the UK Biobank.

### Paper Abstract
Gene-environment (GxE) interactions crucially contribute to complex phenotypes. The statistical power of GxE interaction studies is often limited due to weak GxE effect sizes.  We develop a testing procedure to evaluate combined genetic and GxE effects on a multivariate phenotype to enhance the power by merging pleiotropy in the main genetic and GxE effects. The method is applied to lipid phenotypes (HDL, LDL, TG) with sleep duration as the environmental factor.
