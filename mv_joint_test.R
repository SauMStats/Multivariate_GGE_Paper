# Multivariate Joint GGE test script for continuous phenotypes.
# Title: A multivariate approach to joint testing of main genetic and gene-environment interaction effects
# Author: Saurabh Mishra, Arunabha Majumdar
# Description: This script performs multivariate regression to evaluate combined genetic and gene-environment (GxE) effects on lipid traits using data from the UK Biobank.

# Load required libraries
# library(dplyr) # Add other required libraries

# Load genotype and phenotype data
# Example of how to load data:
# geno <- readRDS("geno_file.rds")
# phenotype_data <- readRDS("phenotype_data.rds")

# Define main analysis steps:
# 1. Extract genotype data
# 2. Perform linear regression models for G, GE, and GGE tests
# 3. Compile p-values from multivariate tests for HDL, LDL, and TG
